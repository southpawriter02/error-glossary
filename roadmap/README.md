# Error Glossary: A Developer's Companion for Cryptic Errors

Welcome to the Error Glossary project! This repository contains the roadmap and planning documents for building a comprehensive, community-driven resource for demystifying common programming errors.

## 1. Project Vision

The goal of this project is to create a static website that serves as a friendly, human-readable guide to cryptic error messages. It aims to go beyond simple fixes by explaining *why* an error occurs, providing clear, annotated code examples, and offering preventative strategies to help developers write better code.

## 2. Key Features

*   **Searchable Database:** A collection of error messages from various languages, easily searchable.
*   **Clear Explanations:** Each error entry includes a simple explanation, a "bad code" example, a "good code" example, and a "Key Takeaway" section.
*   **Community-Driven:** The project will be open to community contributions for new error messages and language support.
*   **Browser Extension:** A planned browser extension will detect errors on popular developer sites and link directly to the relevant glossary page.

## 3. How to Use This Repository

This repository is for planning and documentation purposes. The files are organized into directories that represent the different phases and features of the project. Each Markdown file provides a detailed breakdown of a specific feature, requirement, or content area.

## 4. Getting Involved

We welcome contributions to the roadmap and documentation! If you have ideas for features, enhancements, or new error messages to include, please refer to the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file for guidelines on how to get started.
