# Introduction

Welcome to the **Error Glossary**!

This site is dedicated to demystifying those cryptic programming error messages we all encounter. Instead of just giving you a quick fix, we aim to help you understand *why* the error happened, so you can prevent it in the future.

## How to use this glossary

*   **Search:** Use the search bar to type in your error message or keywords.
*   **Browse:** Explore errors by programming language using the sidebar.
*   **Learn:** Each error page provides a simple explanation, examples of bad and good code, and key takeaways.
